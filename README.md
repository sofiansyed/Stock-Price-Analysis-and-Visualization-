# Stock-Price-Analysis-and-Visualization-
This repository contains a comprehensive project focused on analyzing stock price data using Python and Power BI. The project involves the following key components:

Data Analysis with Python:
We preprocessed and cleaned historical stock price data, engineered features, and performed regression modeling to predict stock price movements.
Calculations included daily price changes, moving averages, and cumulative price changes.

Visualization with Power BI:
We created interactive dashboards to visualize daily price changes, monthly trends, and cumulative price changes.
The visualizations help in understanding the stock performance and trends over different periods.

Files Included:
Dataset: The historical stock price data used for analysis.
HTML: Exported Python code for reference and review.
Power BI Visualization: Detailed explanations and screenshots of the Power BI visualizations.
Presentation: PowerPoint slides summarizing the project steps, methodology, and findings.
This project demonstrates a practical application of data analysis and visualization techniques to financial data, providing insights into stock price dynamics and trends.
